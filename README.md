# hello-world
my first repository:
 I've just begun CS50x, Harvard's intro to computer science through edX.org. I've already taken comp sci 1 and 2 at my local community college and I'm transferring to UMBC this fall. I hope to learn even more from this course so I'm better prepared when I begin my classes at the university.
